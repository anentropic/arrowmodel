   :description: Install arrowmodel and convert your first Arrow RecordBatch into Pydantic model instances in under 5 minutes.

Getting Started
===============

In this tutorial you will install arrowmodel, define a Pydantic model, create
some Arrow data, and convert it into a list of typed model instances -- all in
under 5 minutes. By the end you will have a working feel for the library's core
loop: Arrow data in, Pydantic models out.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.11 or later
- Familiarity with Pydantic v2 ``BaseModel`` definitions
- Familiarity with pyarrow ``RecordBatch`` (or any Arrow-producing library)

Install arrowmodel
------------------

arrowmodel ships as a pre-built binary wheel. No Rust toolchain is needed on
your machine.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: pip

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install arrowmodel

   .. tab-item:: uv

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv add arrowmodel

You will also need pyarrow (or another Arrow-PyCapsule-compatible library such
as Polars) to create Arrow data. If you do not have it already:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: pip

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install pyarrow

   .. tab-item:: uv

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv add pyarrow

Define a Pydantic model
-----------------------

Start by defining the shape of the data you expect. This is a standard Pydantic
v2 model -- nothing special yet.

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class User(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       email: str
       score: float

Each field name corresponds to a column name in the Arrow data you will
convert next.

Create some Arrow data
----------------------

Build a ``RecordBatch`` with columns that match your model fields.

.. code-block:: python

   import pyarrow as pa

   batch = pa.record_batch(
       {
           "id": [1, 2, 3],
           "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"],
           "email": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "carol@example.com"],
           "score": [9.5, 8.0, 7.3],
       }
   )

In a real application this data would come from a database query (ADBC, Flight
SQL), a Parquet file, or a Polars DataFrame. The ``RecordBatch`` is the common
hand-off point.

Convert to model instances
--------------------------

Now for the good part. Use :py:func:`~arrowmodel.model_convert` to turn the
batch into a list of ``User`` instances:

.. code-block:: python

   from arrowmodel import model_convert

   users = model_convert(User, batch)

   for user in users:
       print(f"{user.name} ({user.email}): {user.score}")

You should see:

.. code-block:: text

   Alice (alice@example.com): 9.5
   Bob (bob@example.com): 8.0
   Carol (carol@example.com): 7.3

That is the entire workflow. Arrow columns were mapped to model fields by name,
values were extracted directly from Arrow buffers in Rust, and each row was
assembled into a ``User`` instance via ``model_construct`` -- no intermediate
Python dicts were created.

.. tip::

   ``model_convert`` creates a fresh converter on every call. If you will
   convert many batches with the same model, look at
   :py:class:`~arrowmodel.ArrowModelConverter` or the
   :py:class:`~arrowmodel.ArrowModel` base class in the
   :ref:`how-to-choose-api-style` guide -- they compile the field mapping once
   and reuse it.

Try with a Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``Table`` is just multiple ``RecordBatch`` objects bundled together.
arrowmodel handles both transparently:

.. code-block:: python

   # Using the same User model and batch from above
   table = pa.Table.from_batches([batch, batch])
   users = model_convert(User, table)
   print(len(users))  # 6

What you learned
----------------

- arrowmodel installs as a binary wheel -- no Rust toolchain required.
- You define a Pydantic ``BaseModel`` whose field names match Arrow column names.
- :py:func:`~arrowmodel.model_convert` converts a ``RecordBatch`` or ``Table``
  into a ``list`` of model instances in a single call.
- Conversion happens in Rust via the Arrow C Data Interface -- no intermediate
  Python dicts.

Next steps
----------

- :ref:`how-to-choose-api-style` -- pick between the convenience function,
  the converter class, or the ``ArrowModel`` base class.
- :ref:`how-to-use-validated-mode` -- enable full Pydantic validation when you
  need it.
- :ref:`explanation-fast-vs-validated` -- understand the performance trade-offs
  between the fast path and the validated path.
